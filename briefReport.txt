Project Summary
This project integrates four key services: User, Comment, Post, and Friendship, each playing
a pivotal role in a cohesive microservices architecture. A central aspect of the system design
is the verification of parent entities before the creation of any related instances, ensuring
data integrity across services.

User Service: Central to user management, it validates user existence for other services.

Post Service: Functions as an intermediary, verifying user existence before post creation
and linking comments to posts.

Comment Service: Manages comments, relying on Post Service for user information and post association.

Friendship Service: Manages user relationships, its integration posed significant architectural challenges.

Challenges and Learnings
Architecture Complexity: The integration of the Friendship Service with the User Service presented
notable architectural challenges, especially in ensuring synchronized communication and data integrity.

Resilience4j Integration: Our attempts to implement resilience with Resilience4j were particularly challenging,
and unfortunately, we could not succeed in this aspect.

These challenges brought to light key learnings, most notably the critical nature of thorough planning in
microservices architecture and the intricacies involved in integrating third-party technologies.
