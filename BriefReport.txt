Brief Report

A) Architecture:

    Our Spring Social application is a microservices-based platform with foundational features such as creating posts,
    commenting, and managing friend requests.

    To build and implement this application we used Spring Initializer, Gradle, Docker Desktop, and Postman.

    The key modules of this application under our SpringSocial parent directory are the following microservices:
        - user-service: manages user-related data, including user profiles.
        - post-service: manages user posts and their associated data.
        - comment-service: handles comments on posts, where users can add comments to posts.

    Each of the microservices has its:
        * model: contains data models used in the microservice.
        * controller: handles HTTP requests and define RESTful endpoints.
        * repository: database interactions and CRUD operations.
        * service: includes business logic for each microservice.
        * DTO: used for the transfer of data between microservice.

B) Challenges faced:

    At first, we had issues managing our git actions to our repository. However, with a bit of management and
    organization we managed to continue without any issues.

    William had issues with the creation and running of microservice images, eventually we managed to make it work.

    Later on, we were faced with another problem. In which, we tried to implement JPA relational databases to
    user-service and comment-service using Postgres, but in the end we could not make it work.

C) Lessons learned:

    We have improved our management and organizational skills. We realized that collaborating each step between
    each other is crucial.

    Our understanding of IntelliJ, Spring Framework, Docker Desktop, and GitHub has evolved.
