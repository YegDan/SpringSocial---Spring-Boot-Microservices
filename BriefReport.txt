Brief Report

A) Architecture:

    Our Spring Social application is a microservices-based platform with foundational features such as creating posts,
    commenting, and managing friend requests.

    The key modules of this application under our SpringSocial parent directory are the following microservices:
        - user-service: manages user-related data, including user profiles.
        - post-service: manages user posts and their associated data.
        - comment-service: handles comments on posts, where users can add comments to posts.
        - friendship-service: manages users' friends and friend requests.
        - discovery-service: acts as a registry for all the microservices in the application.
        - api-gateway: entry point for all client requests to the backend of the Spring Social application.

    Each of the microservices has its:
        * config: either security or web config files
        * model: contains data models used in the microservice.
        * controller: handles HTTP requests and define RESTful endpoints.
        * repository: database interactions and CRUD operations.
        * service: includes business logic for each microservice.
        * DTO: used for the transfer of data between microservice.

B) Challenges faced:

    Initially, William had issues with his Docker Desktop and Postman. He was working on Friendship-Service but
    unfortunately the friendship container would not work, Yeganeh stepped in and managed to fix the friendship
    service. Yeganeh had some issues with implementing the resilience4j for the fallback methods but in the end
    it worked out.

C) Lessons learned:

    We have improved our management and organizational skills. We realized that collaborating each step between
    each other is crucial.

    Our understanding of IntelliJ, Spring Framework, Docker Desktop, and GitHub has evolved.
